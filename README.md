# Avasky - BETA

---


Our service is a skill/activity verification platform as well as a means to establish access to resources with passwordless logins via Magic Links.

Current BETA program also aims at creating short profiles that you can share via skylinks.

This is a proof of concept.

## What are Skylinks?

---

We are using a decentralized CDN platform called Skynet ( powered by Sia ) for storage of profile pages. This is done by assigning each profile with a skylink.

## Magic Links

---

Magic Links offer an SDK for 'passwordless logins'. The service allows you to authenticate via email by verifying a certain link, as well as implement social and WebAuthn logins.
