# Avasky - BETA

---

Our service enables your business(or even your personal project!) to create passwordless, yet secure login methods to your resources by the use of Magic Links. This technology
further allows us to provide a means of verifying work/skill in a decentralized way, adding all these to a profile.

Current status: BETA.

## What are Skylinks?

---

We are using a decentralized CDN platform called Skynet ( powered by Sia ) for storage.

## Magic Links

---

Magic Links offer an SDK for 'passwordless logins'. The service allows you to authenticate via email by verifying a certain link, as well as implement social and WebAuthn logins.

## Further details

This project was created with awesomeness by the OpenENSO team for the SkyDB Debut Hackathon !
